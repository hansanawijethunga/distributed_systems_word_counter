What is Intelligent Agent??
 • an agent program that implements the agent function— the
mapping from percepts to actions.
• the architecture is some sort of computing device with physical
sensors and actuators that run the program
 • agent = architecture + program
• the program has to be one that is appropriate for the
architecture.
 • If the program is going to recommend actions like Walk, the architecture had better have
legs. The architecture might be just an ordinary PC, or it might be a robotic car with
several onboard computers, cameras, and other sensors
